# Experienced Anvils 

Removes the 39 xp level limit in anvils. 

This mod still partially works when only present on one side  
 \- Server side: removes the level limit  
 \- Client side: correctly displays the xp cost instead of saying "TOO EXPENSIVE" but is not required for the core functionality
  
Can also fix the anvil text if playing on a vanilla-compatible Fabric server with [![CurseForge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/title/305480.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-fix "AnvilFix on CurseForge"), or possibly other Fabric mods that remove the xp limit.

NOTE: renaming an item will still cost at most 39 levels

Please create an [issue](https://github.com/Gluton-Official/ExperiencedAnvils/issues) if you find a scenario where the incorrect text is shown in an anvil, or if would like compatability with another mod.
