[Experienced Anvils](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/expanvils "Experienced Anvils on CurseForge") [![CurseForge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_443044_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/expanvils "Experienced Anvils on CurseForge")

Client side only mod for displaying anvil level costs over 39 (which means the server needs to remove the limit).

Intended to be used on a Forge client when playing on a Fabric server with [![CurseForge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/title/305480.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-fix "AnvilFix on CurseForge"), but there might be other uses.
